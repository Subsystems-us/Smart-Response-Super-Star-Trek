FSS ENTERPRISE NCC-1701

                       
SIMULATION OF A MISSION  OF THE STARSHIP ENTERPRISE, AS SEEN ON THE ORIGINAL 
STAR TREK TV SERIES. ORIGINAL PROGRAM BY MIKE MAYFIELD, MODIFIED VERSION 
PUBLISHED IN "101 BASIC GAMES", AS "STREK7" 1/12/75 BY DAVE AHL. 
MODIFICATIONS TO THE LATTER (PLUS DEBUGGING) BY BOB LEEDOM - APRIL & DECEMBER 
1974, WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM HIS FRIENDS . . .
  (OTHER VERSIONS WERE WIDELY AVAILABLE FOR HP BASIC, TRS-80 BASIC, 
   BERKELY TINY-BASIC AND EVEN FORTRAN. -- RN)
CONVERTED TO MICROSOFT 8K BASIC 3/16/78 BY JOHN BORDERS.
HACKED INTO OPEN SOURCE PHP 7/4/04 BY RIK NILSSON. 
(NEW ASCII ART COURTESY JOSHUA BELL)

This version is based on the concepts generated above and written ANSI C for
Arduino for use on the SmartResponse XE by Dan Geiger. 7/19/2023.

Instructions:

1. THE GALAXY IS DIVIDED INTO AN 8 X 8 QUADRANT GRID, AND EACH QUADRANT
   IS FURTHER DIVIDED INTO AN 8 X 8 SECTOR GRID.

2. YOU WILL BE ASSIGNED A STARTING POINT SOMEWHERE IN THE GALAXY TO
   BEGIN A TOUR OF DUTY AS COMMANDER OF THE STARSHIP ENTERPRISE.
   YOUR MISSION: TO SEEK AND DESTROY THE DISPERSED FLEET OF KLINGON 
   WARSHIPS WHICH IS MENACING THE UNITED FEDERATION OF PLANETS.
   STARDATES ADVANCE IN INCREMENTS OF WARP FACTOR WHEN YOU MOVE -- 
   IT'S A RELATIVISTIC THING -- SITTING AT A SECTOR LOCATION FIRING 
   AT KLINGONS USES ENERGY, BUT YOU DO NOT ADVANCE IN TIME.

3. YOU HAVE THE FOLLOWING COMMANDS AVAILABLE TO YOU AS CAPTAIN OF THE
   STARSHIP ENTERPRISE:
            
    NAV -- WARP ENGINE CONTROL. 
           COURSE IS IN A CIRCULAR NUMERICAL   315  0   45
           COMPASS DIRECTION:                     . . .
           INTEGER AND REAL VALUES MAY BE          ...
           USED. (0-360 ARE VALID)           270 ---*--- 90
                                                   ...
                                                  . . .
                                              225  180   135
           
                                                  COURSE
           ONE WARP FACTOR IS THE SIZE OF
           ONE QUADRANT. THEREFORE, TO GET
           FROM QUADRANT 6-5 TO 5-5 YOU WILL
           USE COURSE 0, WARP FACTOR 1.
           MOVING COSTS ENERGY AND STARDATES.
           
    SRS -- SHORT RANGE SENSOR SCAN
           SHOWS YOU A TACTICAL PLOT OF YOUR PRESENT QUADRANT.
           SYMBOLOGY ON YOUR SENSOR SCAN IS AS FOLLOWS:
             E = YOUR STARSHIP'S POSITION
             K = KLINGON BATTLE CRUISER
             B = FEDERATION STARBASE AT WHICH YOU CAN 
                 REFUEL, REPAIR AND RE-ARM
             * = A STAR
             . = EMPTY SPACE
           
    LRS -- LONG RANGE SENSOR SCAN
           SHOWS CONDITIONS IN SPACE FOR ONE QUADRANT ON EACH
           SIDE OF THE ENTERPRISE (WHICH IS IN THE CENTER OF
           THE SCAN). THE SCAN IS CODED IN THE FORM "KBS" WHERE
           K = THE NUMBER OF KLINGONS, "B" THE NUMBER OF BASES,
           AND "S" THE NUMBER OF STARS.
           EXAMPLE: 207 = 2 KLINGONS, 0 STARBASES, & 7 STARS.
           
    PHA -- PHASER CONTROL
           ALLOWS YOU TO DESTROY THE KLINGON BATTLE CRUISERS BY
           ZAPPING THEM WITH SUITABLY LARGE UNITS OF ENERGY TO
           DEPLETE THEIR SHIELD POWER. (REMEMBER, KLINGONS HAVE
           PHASERS TOO!). TOTAL ENERGY IS DIVIDED EQUALLY AMONG
           THE KLINGONS IN THE SECTOR.
           
    TOR -- PHOTON TORPEDO CONTROL
           TORPEDO COURSE IS THE SAME AS USED IN WARP ENGINE
           CONTROL. IF YOU HIT THE KLINGON VESSEL, HE IS REDUCED BY 200
           UNITS WHICH ONLY THE STRONGEST KLINGONS CAN SURVIVE. 
           IF YOU MISS, YOU ARE SUBJECT TO HIS PHASER FIRE. 
           IN EITHER CASE, YOU ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO THE PHASER FIRE
           OF ANY OTHER KLINGONS IN THE QUADRANT.
           THE LIBRARY COMPUTER COMMAND "COM" CAN ALLOW YOU TO 
           COMPUTE THE TORPEDO COURSE FOR YOU. IF YOU DO THIS,
           THE KLINGON MAY HAVE TIME TO FIRE ON YOU. TORPEDOES
           COST 20 ENERGY UNITS TO FIRE.
           
    SHE -- SHIELD CONTROL
           DEFINES THE NUMBER OF ENERGY UNITS TO BE ASSIGNED TO
           THE SHIELDS. ENERGY IS TAKEN FROM TOTAL SHIP'S ENERGY.
           NOTE THAT THE STATUS DISPLAY "TOTAL ENERGY" INCLUDES
           SHIELD ENERGY. THERE IS AN ENERGY COST TO HAVING THE
           SHIELDS UP.
           
    DAM -- DAMAGE CONTROL REPORT REQUEST
           GIVES THE STATE OF REPAIR OF ALL DEVICES. WHERE A 
           NEGATIVE "STATE OF REPAIR" SHOWS THAT THE DEVICE IS
           TEMPORARILY DAMAGED AND THE VALUE IS THE NUMBER OF
           STARDATES TO REPAIR.
           
    COM -- INVOKE LIBRARY COMPUTER
           THE LIBRARY COMPUTER CONTAINS FOUR OPTIONS:
           1 = CUMULATIVE GALACTIC RECORD
               THIS OPTION SHOWS THE COMPUTER HISTORY OF THE RESULTS
               OF PREVIOUS SHORT AND LONG RANGE SENSOR SCANS. AN
               ASTERISK APPEARS IF YOU HAVE NEVER SCANNED THAT QUADRANT.
               A NUMBER INDICATES THE NUMBER OF KLINGONS. AN "X" IS YOUR
               LOCATION, AND IN INVERSE FIELD MEANS THERE IS A BASE.
           2 = STATUS REPORT. THIS OPTION SHOWS DATA INCLUDING ENERGY,
               SHIELDS, NUMBER OF REMAINING KLINGONS, STARDATES, AND TIME
               REMAINING.
           3 = STARBASE NAV DATA. THIS OPTION GIVES THE COURSE
               AND DISTANCE TO ANY STARBASE IN YOUR QUADRANT.
               THIS IS TO THE STARBASE ITSELF SO ENSURE YOU ALLOW
               AN OFFSET TO PREVENT RUNNING INTO THE STARBASE.
           4 = TARGETTING COMPUTER. THIS GIVES THE COURSES
               AND DISTANCES TO ALL THE KLINGONS IN YOUR QUADRANT.
               KLINGONS MAY FIRE DUE TO THE DELAY IN INSTIGATING
               AN ATTACK.

    PWR -- POWER OFF THE UNIT. THIS PUTS THE DEVICE IN LOW POWER STATE
           BUT WILL SAVE YOUR DATA. PRESS THE BUTTON ON THE TOP OF THE UNIT
           TO WAKE THE DEVICE UP.

    OPT -- OPTIONS. HERE YOU CAN QUIT THE GAME. THERE IS ALSO A SECTION
           THAT ALLOWS YOU TO SET SOME OF THE LIMITS OF THE GAME. IF THE
           GAME IS TOO EASY, YOU CAN GO TO THIS SECTION TO MAKE IT MORE
           CHALLENGING. IF YOUR SHIELDS RUN OUT, YOU WILL ALWAYS SUSTAIN
           DAMAGE FROM ATTACKS, BUT YOU MAY ALSO SUSTAIN DAMAGE WITH SHIELDS
           STILL UP. THE "DAMAGE FROM ATTACK" SETTING CONTROLS THE ODDS OF THIS
           HAPPENING. IT IS SET TO 2 OF 10. BUT YOU CAN SET THIS HIGHER.
           THE SAME GOES FOR THE DAMAGE INCURRED IF YOU HIT A BOUNDARY. YOU
           CAN ALSO CHANGE HOW POWERFUL THE KLINGONS ARE. KLINGON STRENTH
           IS A FACTOR YOU CAN SET. IT DEFAULTS TO 1.0, BUT IF YOU WANT THE
           KLINGONS TO BE TOUGHER, YOU COULD SET THIS TO 1.5 OR 2.0. THIS
           WILL MAGNIFY THE STREGNTH OF THEIR ATTACKS. FINALLY, YOU CAN
           ALSO CHANGE YOUR CURRENT ENERGY LEVEL. YOU MAY WANT TO START
           WITH 2000 UNITS TO MAKE IT MORE CHALLENGING.

4. KLINGONS ENERGY LEVEL CAN BE FROM 100 TO 250 WHEN INITIALLIZED. IF
   YOU LEAVE THE SECTOR AND RETURN, THE KLINGONS MAY HAVE RELOCATED
   AND MADE REPAIRS.

5. WHEN NAVIGATING AND ATTACKING, YOU MUST HAVE A CLEAR PATH (NO STARS
   OR BASES IN THE WAY). BASED ON THE GRID NATURE OF THE GAME, ONLY
   DIRECTIONS 0, 45, 90, 135, 180, 225, 270, AND 315 ARE CHECKED.
